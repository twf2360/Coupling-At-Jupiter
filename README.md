Jupiter is one of the most fascinating bodies in the solar system - in part due to it's massive size and mass. Jupiter's magnetosphere is the largest object in the solar system, spanning hundreds of jovian radii. Io, a volcanic moon of Jupiter ejects one ton/s of neutral material into the magnetosphere. As this material is ionised, it is picked up by the magnetosphere, and sent outwards.
