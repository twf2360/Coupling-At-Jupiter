## MPhys Project - Coupling at Jupiter
 
Magnetic fields play a pivotal role throughout space, as all charged particles feel their effects. A planet with a large enough internally generated magnetic field will form a magnetosphere - a magnetic field that dominates in the region of space surrounding the planet. The magnetosphere of Jupiter is a fascinating environment: the enormity of the planet - both its mass, and its magnetic field - combined with fast axial rotation, and a complex satellite system leads to unique interactions not seen anywhere else in the solar system. 

The ultimate objective of this project is to build a model the magnetosphere of Jupiter, particulalry looking at the effect of the asymmetric rotation and dipole field axis which are offset by approximately 9&deg;. Before reaching this objective however, there will be many smaller stages along the way. This includes a model of the radial outflow of plasma compared to the local alfven velocity, and a line trasce of the magnetic field.
