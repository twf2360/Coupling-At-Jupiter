This directory is the starting point for the larger model going forward! 
The first objective is to desgin a way of tracing a magnetic field. 

dipole.py is my first at attempt at this, using a massively simplified version of Jupiters magnetic field - a simple dipole. Even simpler - in 2D! 
The output from dipole.py is saved into the images folder.
